What is a Malware?
 • Malware, short for malicious software, is a program or code that is used to disrupt computer’s normal operation.

Types of Malware:

1. Virus: Software or code that infects other software when it is downloaded, activating or reproducing itself whenever the attacked software is run. A virus can be 
   programmed to do any number of harmful things, including stealing data and disrupting systems.
   
   Infects: Usually spread via infected websites, file sharing, or email attachment downloads, a virus will lie dormant until the infected host file or program is activated. Once that happens, the virus is able to replicate itself and spread through your systems.
   
Viruses can:        
a)Seize applications        
b)Send infected files to contact lists       
c)Steal data
d)Launch DDoS attacks   
e)Launch ransomware attacks

2. Worm: Like a virus, a worm can destroy data and programs while replicating itself on a computer. Unlike a virus, which initially requires a human to download and activate it, a worm spreads automatically on a computer or throughout a network.

Worm malware can:        
1)Delete or modify files        
2)Steal data        
3}Install backdoors for hackers         
4)Launch DDoS attacks        
5)Launch ransomware attacks        
6)Create botnets        
7)Infect many computers at once
  

3. Trojan horse: A Trojan horse is designed to appear as a legitimate software program to gain access to a system. Once activated following installation, Trojans can 
   execute their malicious functions.

   Infects: Disguises itself as a legitimate file and because it looks trustworthy, users download it thereby infecting his system.
   
   Trojan can:         
a)Delete, modify, or steal data         
b)Spy on users        
c)Access networks        
d)Launch DDoS attacks        
e)Take remote control of device

   
4. Spyware: Spyware is made to collect information and data on the device and user, as well as observe the user’s activity without their knowledge.

   Infects: Spyware is a common threat, usually distributed as freeware or shareware that has an appealing function on the front end with a covert mission running in the background that you might never notice. It’s often used to carry out identity theft and credit card fraud.
   
Spyware can:
a)Breach personal privacy  
b)Collects confidential data, including by logging keystrokes
c)Steal data  

5. Ransomware: Ransomware is designed to infect a user’s system and encrypt its data. Cybercriminals then demand a ransom payment from the victim in exchange for decrypting the system’s data.
    
  Infects: It often spread through phishing emails that contain malicious attachments or through drive-by downloading. 

6. Backdoor virus or Remote Access Trojan (RAT): It secretly creates a backdoor into an infected computer system that enables threat actors to remotely access it  
   without alerting the user or the system’s security programs.
   
   Infects: A backdoor virus can come attached to the file-sharing programs or e-mail messages. By giving them unsuspicious names, their authors trick users into  
   executing or opening such files. Very often, backdoors are installed by other parasites like Trojans, viruses, or even spyware.
   
 7. Adware: Adware is used to track a user’s browser and download history with the intent to display pop-up or banner advertisements that lure the user into making a   
    purchase. For example, an advertiser might use cookies to track the WebPages a user visits to better target advertising.

    Infects: Bad apps are malicious apps that can install malware on your device. Similar to a computer, you can get adware through a browser vulnerability that can allow pop-ups ads. When a bad app is infected with adware, you can be bombarded by persistent ads.
 
Adware can: 
1)Be an annoyance
2)Lure users to malicious sites
3)Install spyware
4)Share user data with third parties

 8. Rootkit: A rootkit is created to obtain administrator-level access to the victim’s system. Once installed, the program gives threat actors root or privileged  
   access to the system. It is a  malware that grants cybercriminals remote control of victims’ devices, oftentimes without the victims’ knowledge. Since rootkits are designed to remain hidden, they can hijack or subvert security software, making it likely that this type of malware could live on your computer for a long time causing significant damage. 

Rootkits can:
a)Take remote control of devices
b)Grant cybercriminals admin access to devices       
c)Spy on users activity

    
 9. Keyloggers: Keyloggers, also called system monitors, are used to track nearly everything a user does on their computer. This includes emails, opened WebPages, 
    programs and keystrokes.
    
    Infects: A software keylogger is put on a computer when the user downloads an infected application. Once installed, the keylogger monitors the keystrokes on the  
    operating system you are using, checking the paths each keystroke goes through.

 10. Bots or Botnets: A computer that, unknown to its owner, has been compromised by an attacker through a virus or trojan and added to a botnet -a network of 
     compromised machines that are then used for nefarious purposes, such as sending spam or launching denial-of-service attacks.

     Infects: One of the most common ways in which bots infect your computer is via downloads. Malware is delivered in download format via social media or email messages that advise clicking a link. The link is often in picture or video form, with either containing viruses and other malware.
     
Bots or botnets can:
a)Launch DDoS attacks
b)Record activity, including keystrokes, webcam, and take screenshots
c)Send phishing emails from your device
d)Give hackers remote control of devices

 11. Fileless Malware:Fileless malware is a type of malicious activity that uses native, legitimate tools built into a system to execute a cyber attack. Unlike traditional malware, fileless malware does not require an attacker to install any code on a target’s system, making it hard to detect. This fileless technique of using native tools to conduct a malicious attack is called “living off the land.”
 
Fileless Malware Techniques:
While attackers don’t have to install code to launch a fileless malware attack, they still need to get access to the environment so they can modify its native tools to serve their purposes. Access and attacks can be accomplished in several ways, such as through the use of:

a)Exploit kits:Exploits are pieces of code, sequences of commands, or collections of data, and exploit kits are collections of exploits. Adversaries use these tools to take advantage of vulnerabilities that are known to exist in an operating system or an installed application. Exploits are an efficient way to launch a fileless malware attack because they can be injected directly into memory without requiring anything to be written to disk. Adversaries can use them to automate initial compromises at scale.

b)Registry resident malware: Registry resident malware is malware that installs itself in the Windows registry in order to remain persistent while evading detection.
Commonly, Windows systems are infected through the use of a dropper program that downloads a malicious file. This malicious file remains active on the targeted system, which makes it vulnerable to detection by antivirus software. Fileless malware may also use a dropper program, but it doesn’t download a malicious file. Instead, the dropper program itself writes malicious code straight into the Windows registry.The malicious code can be programmed to launch every time the OS is launched, and there is no malicious file that could be discovered – the malicious code is hidden in native files not subject to AV detection.

c)Memory-only malware: Memory-only malware resides only in memory. An example of memory-only malware is the Duqu worm, which can remain undetected because it resides exclusively in memory. Duqu 2.0 comes in two versions; the first is a backdoor that allows the adversary to gain a foothold in an organization. The adversary can then use the advanced version of Duqu 2.0, which offers additional features such as reconnaissance, lateral movement and data exfiltration. Duqu 2.0 has been used to successfully breach companies in the telecom industry and at least one well-known security software provider.

d)Fileless ransomware: Adversaries do not limit themselves to one type of attack. They use any technology that will help them capture their payload. Today, ransomware attackers are using fileless techniques to embed malicious code in documents through the use of native scripting languages such as macros or to write the malicious code directly into memory through the use of an exploit. The ransomware then hijacks native tools like PowerShell to encrypt hostage files without ever having written a single line to disk.

e)Stolen credentials: Attackers may commence a fileless attack through the use of stolen credentials so they can access their target under the guise of a legitimate user. Once inside, the attacker can use native tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or PowerShell to conduct their attack. They can establish persistence by hiding code in the registry or the kernel, or by creating user accounts that grant them access to any system they choose.

12. Mobile Malware: Mobile malware is malicious software specifically designed to target mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with the goal of gaining access to private data. Although mobile malware is not currently as pervasive as malware that attacks traditional workstations, it’s a growing threat because many companies now allow employees to access corporate networks using their personal devices, potentially bringing unknown threats into the environment.

Types of Mobile Malware:

a)Remote Access Tools (RATs): Remote Access Tools (RATs) offer extensive access to data from infected victim devices and are often used for intelligence collection. RATs can typically access information such as installed applications, call history, address books, web browsing history, and sms data. RATs may also be used to send SMS messages, enable device cameras, and log GPS data.

b)Bank trojans: Bank trojans are often disguised as legitimate applications and seek to compromise users who conduct their banking business — including money transfers and bill payments — from their mobile devices. This type of trojan aims to steal financial login and password details.

c)Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware used to lock out a user from their device and demand a “ransom” payment — usually in untraceable Bitcoin. Once the victim pays the ransom, access codes are provided to allow them to unlock their mobile device.

d)Cryptomining Malware: Cryptomining Malware enables attackers to covertly execute calculations on a victim’s device – allowing them to generate cryptocurrency. Cryptomining is often conducted through Trojan code that is hidden in legitimate-looking apps.

e)Advertising Click Fraud: Advertising Click Fraud is a type of malware that allows an attacker to hijack a device to generate income through fake ad clicks.

13. Malvertising: Malvertising, a portmanteau of malicious advertising, is the use of advertising to spread malware. It typically involves injecting malicious or malware-laden advertisements into legitimate advertising networks and webpages. Advertising is a great way to spread malware because significant effort is put into ads to make them attract to users to sell or advertise a product. Malvertising also benefits from the reputation of the sites it is placed on, such as high-profile and reputable news websites. 

14. Browser Hijacker: A browser hijacker or hijackware changes the behavior of a web browser by sending the user to a new page, changing their home page, installing unwanted toolbars, displaying unwanted ads or directing users to a different website.  

15. Crimeware: Crimeware is a class of malware designed to automate cybercrime. It is designed to perpetrate identity theft through social engineering or stealth to access the victim's financial and retail accounts to steal funds or make unauthorized transactions. Alternatively, it may steal confidential or sensitive information as part of corporate espionage. 

16. RAM Scraper: A RAM scraper is a type of malware that harvests the data temporarily stored in-memory or RAM. This type of malware often targets point-of-sale (POS) systems like cash registers because they can store unencrypted credit card numbers for a brief period of time before encrypting them then passing them to the back-end.

17. Rogue Security Software: Rogue security software tricks user into thinking their system has a security problem such as a virus and entices them to pay to have it removed. In reality, the fake security software is the malware that needs to be removed. 

18. Cryptojacking: Cryptojacking is a type of malware that uses a victim's computing power to mine cryptocurrency. 

19. Hybrid Malware: Today most malware is a combination of existing malware attacks, often trojan horses, worms, viruses and ransomware. For example, a malware program may appear to be a trojan but once executed it may act as a worm and try to attack over victims on the network.
