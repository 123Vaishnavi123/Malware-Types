What is a Malware?
 • Malware, short for malicious software, is a program or code that is used to disrupt computer’s normal operation.

Types of Malware:

1. Virus: Software or code that infects other software when it is downloaded, activating or reproducing itself whenever the attacked software is run. A virus can be 
   programmed to do any number of harmful things, including stealing data and disrupting systems.
   
   Infects: Usually spread via infected websites, file sharing, or email attachment downloads, a virus will lie dormant until the infected host file or program is activated. Once that happens, the virus is able to replicate itself and spread through your systems.
   
Viruses can:        
a)Seize applications        
b)Send infected files to contact lists       
c)Steal data
d)Launch DDoS attacks   
e)Launch ransomware attacks

2. Worm: Like a virus, a worm can destroy data and programs while replicating itself on a computer. Unlike a virus, which initially requires a human to download and activate it, a worm spreads automatically on a computer or throughout a network.

Worm malware can:        
1)Delete or modify files        
2)Steal data        
3}Install backdoors for hackers         
4)Launch DDoS attacks        
5)Launch ransomware attacks        
6)Create botnets        
7)Infect many computers at once
  

3. Trojan horse: A Trojan horse is designed to appear as a legitimate software program to gain access to a system. Once activated following installation, Trojans can 
   execute their malicious functions.

   Infects: Disguises itself as a legitimate file and because it looks trustworthy, users download it thereby infecting his system.
   
   Trojan can:         
a)Delete, modify, or steal data         
b)Spy on users        
c)Access networks        
d)Launch DDoS attacks        
e)Take remote control of device

   
4. Spyware: Spyware is made to collect information and data on the device and user, as well as observe the user’s activity without their knowledge.

   Infects: Spyware is a common threat, usually distributed as freeware or shareware that has an appealing function on the front end with a covert mission running in the background that you might never notice. It’s often used to carry out identity theft and credit card fraud.
   
Spyware can:
a)Breach personal privacy  
b)Collects confidential data, including by logging keystrokes
c)Steal data  

5. Ransomware: Ransomware is designed to infect a user’s system and encrypt its data. Cybercriminals then demand a ransom payment from the victim in exchange for decrypting the system’s data.
    
  Infects: It often spread through phishing emails that contain malicious attachments or through drive-by downloading. 

6. Backdoor virus or Remote Access Trojan (RAT): It secretly creates a backdoor into an infected computer system that enables threat actors to remotely access it  
   without alerting the user or the system’s security programs.
   
   Infects: A backdoor virus can come attached to the file-sharing programs or e-mail messages. By giving them unsuspicious names, their authors trick users into  
   executing or opening such files. Very often, backdoors are installed by other parasites like Trojans, viruses, or even spyware.
   
 7. Adware: Adware is used to track a user’s browser and download history with the intent to display pop-up or banner advertisements that lure the user into making a   
    purchase. For example, an advertiser might use cookies to track the WebPages a user visits to better target advertising.

    Infects: Bad apps are malicious apps that can install malware on your device. Similar to a computer, you can get adware through a browser vulnerability that can allow pop-ups ads. When a bad app is infected with adware, you can be bombarded by persistent ads.
 
Adware can: 
1)Be an annoyance
2)Lure users to malicious sites
3)Install spyware
4)Share user data with third parties

 8. Rootkit: A rootkit is created to obtain administrator-level access to the victim’s system. Once installed, the program gives threat actors root or privileged  
   access to the system. It is a  malware that grants cybercriminals remote control of victims’ devices, oftentimes without the victims’ knowledge. Since rootkits are designed to remain hidden, they can hijack or subvert security software, making it likely that this type of malware could live on your computer for a long time causing significant damage. 

Rootkits can:
a)Take remote control of devices
b)Grant cybercriminals admin access to devices       
c)Spy on users activity

    
 9. Keyloggers: Keyloggers, also called system monitors, are used to track nearly everything a user does on their computer. This includes emails, opened WebPages, 
    programs and keystrokes.
    
    Infects: A software keylogger is put on a computer when the user downloads an infected application. Once installed, the keylogger monitors the keystrokes on the  
    operating system you are using, checking the paths each keystroke goes through.

 10. Bots or Botnets: A computer that, unknown to its owner, has been compromised by an attacker through a virus or trojan and added to a botnet -a network of 
     compromised machines that are then used for nefarious purposes, such as sending spam or launching denial-of-service attacks.

     Infects: One of the most common ways in which bots infect your computer is via downloads. Malware is delivered in download format via social media or email messages that advise clicking a link. The link is often in picture or video form, with either containing viruses and other malware.
     
Bots or botnets can:
a)Launch DDoS attacks
b)Record activity, including keystrokes, webcam, and take screenshots
c)Send phishing emails from your device
d)Give hackers remote control of devices
